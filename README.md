## What is Configuration Management?

Configuration management is the process of maintaining the state of a system in a consistent and predictable way. This is done by defining the desired state of the system and then configuring the system to match that state. Configuration management is a key part of infrastructure as code, which is the practice of managing infrastructure through code rather than through manual processes.
